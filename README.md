# üìä SQL vs NoSQL Performance Analyzer

This project compares the performance of **MySQL** and **MongoDB** by measuring the time taken to read records from both databases and displaying the results visually using Flask and Chart.js.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Reads data from both MySQL and MongoDB
- Measures time taken to fetch data from each
- Displays results in a side-by-side bar graph
- Clean HTML chart visualization (Chart.js)
- Includes sample dataset (`books.csv`) and loader scripts
